# Rock, Paper, Scissors!

A simple game of 'rock, paper, scissors' which the user competes against an AI in a round of 5 games.

There are two versions made.  Version one asks the user using a prompt() to participate in the game.  The user will have to type out their answer and hit submit.  Version two implements buttons that the user can click instead of typing the answer out.
